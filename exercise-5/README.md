# Exercise-5
In this exercise, you'll work with a dataset that has the popularity (proportion) of each female name in the United States from 1961 - 2013. Here, you'll write functions that allow you to ask relevant questions of your dataset, and practice reading in real world data.

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository, follow the instructions in the `exercise.R` file, then `add` and `commit` your changes so that you can `push` them back up to GitHub.
