# Exercise 4: Gates Foundation Educational Grants

# Read data into a variable called `grants` using the `read.csv` function
# Make sure *not* to read the strings as factors

# Use the View function to look at your data


# Create a variable `spending` as the `total_amount` column of the dataset


# Confirm that your `spending` variable is a vector using the `is.vector` function


# Create a variable `org` as the `organization` column of the dataset.


### Now you can ask some more interesting questions about the dataset.  Store your answers in variables ###

# What was the mean grant value?


# What was the dollar amount of the largest grant?


# What was the dollar amount of the smallest grant?


# Which organization received the largest grant?


# Which organization received the smallest grant?


# How many grants were awarded in 2010?
