# Exercise 4: Gates Foundation Educational Grants

# Read data into a variable called `grants` using the `read.csv` function
# Make sure *not* to read the strings as factors
grants <- read.csv('data/gates_money.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
# Use the View function to look at your data
View(grants)

# Create a variable `spending` as the `total_amount` column of the dataset
spending <- grants[["total_amount"]]

# Confirm that your `spending` variable is a vector using the `is.vector` function
is.vector(spending)

# Create a variable `org` as the `organization` column of the dataset.
org <- grants[["organization"]]

### Now you can ask some more interesting questions about the dataset.  Store your answers in variables ###

# What was the mean grant value?
mean(grants[["total_amount"]])

# What was the dollar amount of the largest grant?
max(grants[["total_amount"]])

# What was the dollar amount of the smallest grant?
min(grants[["total_amount"]])

# Which organization received the largest grant?
org.max.grant <- org[spending == max(spending)]

# Which organization received the smallest grant?
org.min.grant <- org[spending == min(spending)]

# How many grants were awarded in 2010?
grants.2010 <- length(org[grants[["start_year"]] == 2010])
