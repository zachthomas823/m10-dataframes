# Exercise-4
In this exercise, you'll work with data that details education grants awarded by the Gates Foundation between 2008 and 2010. Once you read in the data, you'll use vector operations you already know to ask real questions about the dataset.

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository, follow the instructions in the `exercise.R` file, then `add` and `commit` your changes so that you can `push` them back up to GitHub.
